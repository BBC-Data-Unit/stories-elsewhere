# Stories elsewhere

This repo is for stories made outside the BBC Data Unit but which we think are worth noting. Here goes...

## Housing

**Alex Homer**'s report [Town halls buy back Right-to-Buy homes](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-39264631) includes a link to [a Google Sheet containing the data from his FOI requests to local authorities](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kZ7XyiCmp2fnL4nzZ-MKjGoc1ccW68pK8Pjpv4AE_Cs/edit#gid=0)

## Pay

The BBC's Visual Journalism unit created a calculator for [Does your job pay less than it did five years ago?](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-40756834) based on [the ONS's Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE)](https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/datasets/regionbyoccupation4digitsoc2010ashetable15). In their methodology they note: "We used hourly pay to work out the gender pay gap and annual pay for all other figures. We selected the median figure rather than the mean, as per ONS advice. We used the CPI measure of inflation to make 'real-terms' adjustments."

## Gender

[Where is the best place to be a woman in Britain?](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-41203240) was a project for BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour. A [report containing some of the analysis for the story is available here](https://downloads.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/bbc-radio-4-womans-hour-best-place-analysis.pdf)
